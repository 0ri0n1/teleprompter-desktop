To create an icon for the Teleprompter app:

1. Visit one of these online icon converter sites:
   - https://redketchup.io/icon-converter
   - https://www.icoconverter.com/
   - https://onlineconvertfree.com/icon-generator/

2. Upload any image you'd like to use as the app icon (ideally something related to teleprompters or text scrolling)

3. Generate the icon file with at least these sizes:
   - 16x16
   - 32x32
   - 48x48
   - 64x64
   - 128x128
   - 256x256

4. Download the resulting .ico file

5. Name it "icon.ico" and place it in the root of the teleprompter-desktop folder (same location as main.js and package.json)

If you don't have an image to use, consider using a teleprompter or scroll icon. You can search for "teleprompter icon" or "scroll icon" on sites like:
